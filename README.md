# line-follower
Line Follower Robot using Arduino Uno

This project was completed as part of the Intro to Electrical and Computer Engineering Course at the University at Albany. The linefollower.ino code was the original code that allowed the robot to work in high light levels. The buttonline.ino code was my improvement to the robot that allowed it to be used and different light levels.
